Project Title: D**evelop a Java Program to Track and Manage Student Grades**<br>

**Project Description**
This project involves creating a Java program to help users track and manage student grades. The program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and displays the overall grade along with additional information, such as a letter grade or GPA. The primary objective is to provide a simple yet effective tool for students or educators to monitor academic performance.

**Key Features**

**User Input:**
The program prompts the user to enter the number of subjects or assignments.
The user can then input grades for each subject or assignment.

**Grade Calculation:**
The program calculates the sum of all grades entered.
It then computes the average grade by dividing the sum by the number of subjects or assignments.

**Display Results:**
The program displays the average grade with two decimal precision.
It determines the letter grade based on the average score using a predefined grading scale.
Optionally, the program can calculate and display the GPA if a GPA scale is provided.

**Detailed Description**<br>
**1. User Input**
The program starts by welcoming the user and prompting them to enter the number of subjects or assignments. This information determines the size of the grades array, which stores the individual grades.

**2. Grade Collection**
The user is asked to input grades for each subject or assignment in a loop. Each grade is added to the sum variable to facilitate the average calculation.

**3. Average Calculation**
The program calculates the average grade by dividing the total sum of grades by the number of subjects or assignments. The average grade is displayed to the user with two decimal precision.

**4. Letter Grade Determination**
The calculateLetterGrade method determines the letter grade based on the average score. The grading scale is as follows:

A: 90 and above
B: 80 to 89.99
C: 70 to 79.99
D: 60 to 69.99
F: Below 60

**5. Optional GPA Calculation**
The program includes a placeholder for GPA calculation. If a GPA scale is available, a method can be implemented to calculate and display the GPA.

**Conclusion**
This Java program provides a straightforward solution for tracking and managing student grades. It allows for easy input, calculation, and display of grades, making it a useful tool for students and educators alike. Future enhancements could include features like storing grades in a file, adding weightage to different subjects, and providing detailed performance reports.
